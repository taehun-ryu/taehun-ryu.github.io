bio: |
  I'm currently pursuing an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence at [UNIST](https://aigs.unist.ac.kr/eng/index.php) and working in the [3D Vision&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Robotics&nbsp;Lab](https://unist.info/) advised by Prof. [Kyungdon Joo](https://unist.info/?page_id=2358).
  I received my B.S. in Robotics from Hanyang University ERICA in 2024.
  My research focuses on how robots perceive the world through sensor calibration, visual SLAM, and event-based vision.
