This project focused on building a practical and cost-efficient autonomous cart system for large indoor retail environments.

## What We Built

- A central main system for global perception and path planning
- Lightweight carts with local control and obstacle handling
- A communication bridge between the main server and each cart

## Technical Highlights

- Unified coordinate system from multiple cameras
- Human tracking and position estimation in large spaces
- Obstacle avoidance using dual LiDAR sensors
- Hybrid localization using wheel encoders and ArUco markers
